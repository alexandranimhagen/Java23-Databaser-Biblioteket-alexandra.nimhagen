Databaser â€“ Bibliotekssystem

A Java library management system interacting with a relational database. Developed as part of a course on databases, it demonstrates CRUD operations, JDBC usage and structured data access.

Features

- Add, update, delete, and list books and users
- Search functionality (by title, author, ISBN etc.)
- Borrowing and return actions with status tracking
- Input validation and error handling
- Command-line interface for user interaction

Technologies Used

- Java  
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)  
- Relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite)  
- SQL scripts for table creation  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alexandranimhagen/Java23-Databaser-Biblioteket-alexandra.nimhagen.git
Set up a database using provided SQL scripts (e.g. schema.sql)

Configure database connection in the code (DBConfig.java or similar)

Open project in your Java IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse etc.)

Run the main class (e.g. LibraryApp.java) and interact via console

What I Learned
This project helped me:

Work with relational databases using JDBC

Design and execute SQL queries for CRUD operations

Handle data mapping between database and Java objects

Structure application code with separation of concerns

This application is part of my Java course and demonstrates fundamental database interaction and backend logic.
